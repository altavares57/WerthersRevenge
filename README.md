## Overview

"Werthers' Revenge" is a top-down, 2D pixel art shooter heavily inspired by the Adobe Shockwave game, "Merlin's Revenge." Unfortunately, after Adobe Shockwave reached its end of life (EOL) in 2019, many fans, including myself, have been unable to enjoy this beloved browser-based video game that captivated players across various websites since its release in 2002. As a result, I have taken it upon myself to create a unique video game that incorporates the core mechanics of "Merlin's Revenge."

At the time of writing (6/11/22), I am still very new to video game development and anticipate dedicating a significant amount of time to this project before it starts to resemble a functioning and enjoyable game. However, I warmly invite you to join me on this journey! I wholeheartedly welcome any feedback, criticism, and potential contributions. 

I have utilized various assets from [opengameart.org ](https://opengameart.org/) while building the skeleton of this project. Please refer to the "Asset Acknowledgements" section of this README for credit to all of the aforementioned assets' rightful owners.

The above instruction is assuming you have Unity Hub installed on your computer. If not, please refer to the link provided in the usage section.

## Usage
To play "Werthers' Revenge," follow these steps:

Ensure you have Unity installed on your computer. If you don't have Unity, you can download it from the official Unity website [Unity Hub Download](https://unity.com/download)

Open Unity Editor.

In Unity, click on "Open" and navigate to the location where you cloned or extracted the repository.

Use the Unity Play button (▶️) or press the designated keyboard shortcut to play the game within the Unity Editor.

Interact with the game using the designated controls or inputs. 

I will be updating these as controls here, but at the time of writing, the movement controls are "W, A, S, D" and the left mouse button is used to shoot. Please note that the shooting mechanic includes a "charge shot" that increases the size of your shot from simply holding in the left mouse button.
